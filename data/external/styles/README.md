STYLES VERSION 2.8.7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains all styles that are compatible with SuperLemmix.

Ensure that it is placed into the root folder of your SuperLemmix directory.

Please check compatibility before using any styles from NeoLemmix, particularly
any styles that use custom Lemmings sprites.

In any case, it's always worth including any styles you have used in your levels
along with the level pack itself, to ensure playability.

If you need any help, visit www.lemmingsforums.net and head to the dedicated
SuperLemmix board for support.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many thanks and kudos to ericderkovits for help maintaining these styles,
I absolutely couldn't have done this by myself
