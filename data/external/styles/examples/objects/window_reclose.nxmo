# Shows how to create a window (entrance) that has a closing animation when all lemmings have been released.
# This animation will only apply if the window has a lemming limit; not if it's infinite and the *level* limit is reached.

# Effect and trigger position are as normal.

TRIGGER_Y 14

# SOUND_EXHAUST specifies the sound to play when the window is exhausted (runs out of lemmings).

# We don't actually display anything for the primary animation. You can include a blank image of the correct size if you
# like, but using *BLANK is a useful shortcut. (*BLANK requires NeoLemmix V12.8.0 or higher.)
# We set the frame count to the same as the opening animation.

# actually hide the animation in Exhausted state, it remains visible.
