# Effect and trigger position are as normal.

# We don't actually display anything for the primary animation. You can include a blank image of the correct size if you
# like, but using *BLANK is a useful shortcut. (*BLANK requires NeoLemmix V12.8.0 or higher.)
# We only need it to have one frame.

# Secondary animation for closing. Here's the magic - we start this on Frame 1, and hide it. Then, when the exit becomes
# exhausted, we make this visible with a LoopToZero state. LoopToZero pauses when it reaches frame 0, but because we don't
# actually hide the animation in Exhausted state, it remains visible.
