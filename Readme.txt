NeoLemmix

Based on Lemmix by EricLang

The backwards-compatible branch of NeoLemmix (including all stable releases with
version number 10.XX.XX) have only been confirmed to compile on Delphi 7.

The "master" branch is Delphi 7 compatible up to and including commit 60368de.
Newer commits have only been confirmed to compile on Delphi XE6, which can also
compile commits as far back as 7b338fa.

All other Delphi versions are unknown, but NeoLemmix does not compile on Lazarus.

You will need a copy of the Graphics32 library, including GR32PNG, in order to
compile NeoLemmix.

Graphics32 can be downloaded here:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/graphics32/files/latest/download?source=files
Installation instructions:
  http://graphics32.org/documentation/Docs/Installation.htm
          
Old versions up to V1.43n-F / V1.43n-F-alt can be found under the "ancient" folder
of branches. Versions older than the latest core version (the second set of digits
in the version number) can be found under the "old" folder of branches. The branches
for versions that match the current core version are found under the "current" folder
of branches.
